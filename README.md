# Gel-Image-Segmentation
This is a custom matlab routine written to automate the measurement of gels taken from experimental images.  
It was written and tested on Matlab_r2015a, February 12, 2015.  There are known issues within the GUI when run on older versions of Matlab,
but these may be resolved by updating Matlab.
